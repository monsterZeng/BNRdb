They combine biological or enzymatic conversion and membrane separation. MBRs have a smaller footprint compared to traditional activated sludge processes and are an attractive choice for processing biodegradable organic matter in wastewater. </p></td>

              <td><p align = "justify">The design of the MBR system varies depending on the nature of the wastewater and treatment goals. Typically, MBR system is made up of aerobic and anaerobic treatment tanks, mixers, aeration system, a flat sheet or hollow fiber ultrafiltration membrane, and either a membrane tank. In the treatment of wastewater that has a high concentration of nitrate an anoxic tank is added, where denitrification occurs. The filtration facility MBR system contains a high concentration of microorganisms (bacteria) that are held within the membrane. The concentration bacteria in the membrane reactor system is 4 to 5 times higher than the moving bed bioreactor and fixed bed bioreactors. A negative pressure is used in order to support the flow of wastewater through the membrane. This process is energy intensive and it is expensive to carry out. In some cases, chemical pumps are added to the system in-order to maintain a favorable optimum pH level and nutrient balance that is essential for a high efficiency in nitrate removal.</p></td>
