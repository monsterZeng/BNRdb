According to the feed uptake by rainbow trout. Salmo gairdneri Richardson, starch was introduced to adjust a nutrient relation of organic C:N of 1·6:1 for the bacterial biomass. Trout grew from 42 g to 254 g in body weight in 118 days. No differences in feed uptake and feed conversion rate were observed in a control group held in a flow‐through system with tap water as culture medium.

The MDR consisted of a reactor with an ultrafiltration membrane unit for removal of micro-particles (e.g. sludge flocs, bacteria and parasites). Specific carrier material provided surfaces for biofilm growth in a fluidized bed reactor with ethanol as carbon source for denitrification. The continuous motion of these carriers cleaned the membrane surface. With online and laboratory measurements of water parameters and operational data the feasibility of the concept was verified. An advantage is that no chemicals are needed to clean the membranes. Examinations of the fish and water analyses proved an MDR can positively influence cortisol, as a stress marker, and the microflora of the aquatic system.

Nevertheless, clogging occurs due to the low hydraulic loads necessary to accomplish anoxic conditions for a successful denitrification process in RAS, which hampers the adjustment of stable working conditions within fixed bed denitrification reactors. Reactors working on the basis of activated sludge demand careful hydraulic control and/or complex configurations for sludge retention. To develop a low-maintenance denitrification reactor, an enclosed moving bed filter, driven by recirculation of the inherent, oxygen poor gas was designed. A Self cleaning Inherent gas Denitrification reactor (SID-reactor) of 0.65 m3, which offered a moving bed volume of 0.39 m3 was connected with a RAS of semi-industrial scale for pike perch (Sander lucioperca) production. This species indicates suboptimal environmental conditions (as e.g. NO3-N concentrations above approximately 68 mg l−1) by prompt reduction of the feed intake. In different experimental series, the SID-reactor was operated with denatured ethanol, methanol, acetic acid or glycerin as carbon sources and changing operational modes. Clogging was prevented by a 40 second inherent gas recirculation twice an hour, which provided continuous, maintenance free operation with marginal energy demand. With inlet (RAS) and outlet NO3-N concentrations in the range of 49 mg l−1 and 12 mg l−1, mean denitrification rates of 199 g to 235 g NO3-N per m3 moving bed volume and day were determined for all tested carbon sources. Negative effects on the feed intake of the reared pike perch were detected with all carbon sources except methanol. Changing the mode of operation to continuous circulation of the filter bed at inlet NO3-N concentrations of 26 mg l−1, the denitrification performance reached 451 g NO3-N per m3 moving bed volume and day. The SID-reactor allowed for the reduction of freshwater exchange in the pike perch RAS from 600 l to 70 l (−88%) and the sodium bicarbonate buffer from 182 g to 31 g (−83%) per kg of administered food. The easy and reliable operation of the SID-reactor could help to establish controlled denitrification as a routine purification step in RAS

During batch experiments removal rates up to 36 mg N/l reactor per day were recorded at a hydraulic residence time of 12 h. To avoid the need for storage of large volumes of hydrogen gas in aquarium or aquaculture applications, an electrochemical cell was used to generate hydrogen gas. During a 7 day aquarium test, a nitrate removal rate up to 18.5 mg N/l reactor per day was recorded at an influent NO3−–N concentration of 20 mg/l.

However, significant water exchange may still be necessary to reduce nitrate concentrations to acceptable levels unless denitrification systems are included in the RAS design. This study evaluated the design of a full scale denitrification reactor in a commercial culture RAS application. Four carbon sources were evaluated including methanol, acetic acid, molasses and Cerelose™, a hydrolyzed starch, to determine their applicability under commercial culture conditions and to determine if any of these carbon sources encouraged the production of two common “off-flavor” compounds, 2-methyisoborneol (MIB) or geosmin. The denitrification design consisted of a 1.89 m3 covered conical bottom polyethylene tank containing 1.0 m3 media through which water up-flowed at a rate of 10 lpm. A commercial aquaculture system housing 6 metric tonnes of Siberian sturgeon was used to generate nitrate through nitrification in a moving bed biological filter. All four carbon sources were able to effectively reduce nitrate to near zero concentrations from influent concentrations ranging from 11 to 57 mg/l NO3–N, and the maximum daily denitrification rate was 670–680 g nitrogen removed/m3 media/day, regardless of the carbon source. Although nitrite production was not a problem once the reactors achieved a constant effluent nitrate, ammonia production was a significant problem for units fed molasses and to a less extent Cerelose™. Maximum measured ammonia concentrations in the reactor effluents for methanol, vinegar, Cerelose™ and molasses were 1.62 ± 0.10, 2.83 ± 0.17, 4.55 ± 0.45 and 5.25 ± 1.26 mg/l NH3–N, respectively. Turbidity production was significantly increased in reactors fed molasses and to a less extent Cerelose™. Concentrations of geosmin and MIB were not significantly increased in any of the denitrification reactors, regardless of carbon source. Because of its very low cost compared to the other sources tested, molasses may be an attractive carbon source for denitrification if issues of ammonia production, turbidity and foaming can be resolved.

In this study, eel were reared in a closed recirculating system, which consisted of a rearing tank, a foam separation unit, a nitrification unit and a denitrification unit. The foam separation unit has an inhalation-type aerator and supplies air bubbles to the rearing water. The growth of eel, which were fed a commercial diet, was satisfactory, with gross weight increases of up three times in 3 months. The survival rate under the congested experimental conditions was 91%. The foam separation unit maintained oxygen saturation in the rearing water at about 80%. Furthermore, fine colloidal substances were absorbed on the stable foam formed from eel mucus and were removed from the rearing water by foam separation. Ammonia oxidation and the removal of suspended solids were accomplished rapidly and simultaneously in the nitrification unit. The ammonia concentration and turbidity were kept at less than 1.2 mg of N per litre and 2.5 units, respectively. When the denitrification process was operated, nitrate that accumulated in the rearing water (151 mg of N per litre) was reduced to 40 mg of N per litre. The sludge was easily recovered from the nitrification and denitrification tanks, and the components were found suitable as compost. Based on these results, the intensive aquaculture of freshwater fish such as eel can be achieved using a closed recirculating system without emission.

Nitrate removal in the aquarium water was accomplished with denitrifiers immobilized in a freeze‐dried, alginate‐starch matrix. Starch served as a bacterial carbon source and cellular matrix‐strengthening filler. Freeze‐dried beads were placed in canisters through which nitrate‐rich aquarium water was recirculated. The freshwater aquarium (100 L) contained goldfish (Carassius auratus ) at a total biomass of 390 g, whereas cichlids (Oreochromis mossambicus ) were kept at a similar stocking density in the marine aquarium. Denitrification resulted in low ambient nitrate concentrations in both aquariums. The specific nitrate removal rate of the freshwater beads was significantly higher (50 μg of NO3‐N/bead/day) than that of seawater beads (5 μg of NO3‐N/bead/day). Differences in ambient nitrate concentrations between both aquariums and diffusion limitation of nitrate to the active denitrification sites within the beads might explain these observed differences.

The most common wastewater denitrification treatment systems utilize methanol-fueled heterotrophs, but sulfur-based autotrophic denitrification may allow a shift away from potentially expensive carbon sources. The objective of this work was to assess the nitrate-reduction potential of fluidized sulfur-based biofilters for treatment of aquaculture wastewater. Three fluidized biofilters (height 3.9 m, diameter 0.31 m; operational volume 0.206 m3) were filled with sulfur particles (0.30 mm effective particle size; static bed depth approximately 0.9 m) and operated in triplicate mode (Phase I: 37–39% expansion; 3.2–3.3 min hydraulic retention time; 860–888 L/(m2 min) hydraulic loading rate) and independently to achieve a range of hydraulic retention times (Phase II: 42–13% expansion; 3.2–4.8 min hydraulic retention time). During Phase I, despite only removing 1.57 ± 0.15 and 1.82 ± 0.32 mg NO3–N/L each pass through the biofilter, removal rates were the highest reported for sulfur-based denitrification systems (0.71 ± 0.07 and 0.80 ± 0.15 g N removed/(L bioreactor-d)). Lower than expected sulfate production and alkalinity consumption indicated some of the nitrate removal was due to heterotrophic denitrification, and thus denitrification was mixotrophic. Microbial analysis indicated the presence of Thiobacillus denitrificans, a widely known autotrophic denitrifier, in addition to several heterotrophic denitrifiers. Phase II showed that longer retention times tended to result in more nitrate removal and sulfate production, but increasing the retention time through flow rate manipulation may create fluidization challenges for these sulfur particles.

Tsukuda et al., 2015	Heterotrophic denitrification of aquaculture effluent using fluidized sand biofilters	nan	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144860914001137	The ability to consistently and cost-effectively reduce nitrate-nitrogen loads in effluent from recirculating aquaculture systems would enhance the industry's environmental stewardship and allow improved facility proximity to large markets in sensitive watersheds. Heterotrophic denitrification technologies specifically employing organic carbon found in aquaculture system waste offer a unique synergy for treatment of land-based, closed-containment production outflows. For space-efficient fluidized sand biofilters to be used as such denitrification reactors, system parameters (e.g., influent dissolved oxygen and carbon to nitrogen ratios, C:N) must be evaluated to most effectively use an endogenous carbon source. The objectives of this work were to quantify nitrate removal under a range of C:Ns and to explore the biofilter bacterial community using three replicated fluidized sand biofilters (height 3.9 m, diameter 0.31 m; fluidized sand volume plus biofilm volume of 0.206 m3) operated at a hydraulic retention time of 15 min and a hydraulic loading rate of 188 L/min m2 at The Conservation Fund Freshwater Institute in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, USA. Nitrate reduction was consistently observed during the biofilter study period (26.9 ± 0.9% removal efficiency; 402 ± 14 g NO3-N/(m3 biofilter d)) although nitrite-N and total ammonium nitrogen concentrations slightly increased (11 and 13% increases, respectively). Nitrate removal efficiency was correlated with carbonaceous oxygen demand to nitrate ratios (R2 > 0.70). Nitrate removal rates during the study period were moderately negatively correlated with influent dissolved oxygen concentration indicating it may be possible the biofilter hydraulic retention time was too short to provide optimized nitrate removal. It is reasonable to assume that the efficiency of nitrate removal across the fluidized sand biofilters could be substantially increased, as long as organic carbon was not limiting, by increasing biofilter bed depths (to 6–10 m), and thus hydraulic retention time. These findings provide a low-cost yet effective technology to remove nitrate-nitrogen from effluent waters of land-based closed-containment aquaculture systems.
